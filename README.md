#German-English Translator
This translator is written in Java, using EM algorithm. It contains the implementations of IBM Model 1 and Model 2, and corresponding evaluation. The training data and evaluating scripts are from Natural Language Processing class of Professor Michael Collins at Columbia University.

##How to run
chmod -x grade.sh  
./grade.sh

##IBM Model 1 Implementation details
My implementation (EM1.java) has the output that is identical to the sample output. To see the output file, please open file q4_output.txt. For more details on implementation, please see the source code in-line comments.

##IBM Model 2 Implementation details
Notice that my implementation (EM2.java) does not run IBM model 2 again, instead, it reads in the serialized file t.ser that is produced in Question 4. The output file has been named as q5_output.txt.

The two models result in similar but slightly different alignment. Because we have modified the parameter estimation process. In particular, we added the alignment information conditioned on the sentence length; consequently, the calculation of ùõø has changed too. The alignment should be more accurate than the one generated in Question 4.

##Translating Components
I directly use the deserialized file em2_t.ser and em2_q.ser to avoid unnecessary computation. The efficiency of this part (Aligner.java) is not so great since for each word of each German sentence, we need to compute the value for every English sentence. For each German token, we need to try all possible alignments to find the maximum. However, since we do not have a large data set, and I have applied some optimization (converting everything into primitive-like int[] in java speeds up the whole process significantly), the process takes around 30s only. The only problem I had during unscrambling is that due to my implementation of IBM model 2, I need to make sure that certain sentence length pair (l, m) in the scrambled.en is in my parameter t and q, since the sentences in scrambled.en are unseen. This is also true for unseen words checking.
